/*
 * 1.	The professor you TA (Training Associate) for, Professor Jackson, shared with you the code she uses to auto-grade studentsâ€™ work. She and the other TAs have encountered some problems with the code in the past when they enter the total possible point value for an assignment. Occasionally, they accidentally enter 0 for the total number of possible points and the program encounters a fatal error when trying to divide by 0.

To help out with this issue, complete a function called divide() in Main. 

The divide() method takes in two parameters: x and y.

Your function should return the result of x/y.

However, if y is zero, you should throw an exception. 

Try to use an ArithmeticException and put your try/catch block in divide() to test out your error-handling skills. 

If an exception is caught, make sure to print out a helpful message.
